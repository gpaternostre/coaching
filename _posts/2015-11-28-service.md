## Client Talk Time
Most of my clients studied English in school. They know the basics of sentence structure. They read English books, news or blogs. They have had plenty of opportunity to use and hear the language in the course of their lives. However, at some point they realised that something was missing. Let's call it **ease**, the ability to go from thought to expression without going though the extra steps of translating and second guessing. They have a blockade in their minds that feels nearly physical at times.

My method wastes no time on elaborate grammar explanations. Everything is done in a communicative environment, where natural and accurate language gets used in context. The same goes for building up sentence complexity, if the situation requires it, you will learn how to do it. I have successfully helped improve clients' response times and confidence when speaking English.<br><br>

I am trained to elicit, rather than give the appropriate language, leading to greater retention rates. I guide clients through a natural process of interaction to high levels of confidence and comfort when communicating in English.
