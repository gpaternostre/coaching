## Client Talk Time
Most of my clients studied English in school. They know the basics of sentence structure. They read English books, news or blogs. They have had plenty of opportunity to use and hear the language in the course of their lives. However, at some point they realised that something was missing. Let's call it **ease**, the ability to go from thought to expression without going though the extra steps of translating and second guessing. They have a strongly felt blockade in their mind that feels nearly physical at times.  

I have successfuly helped dramatically improve clients' response times and confidence when speaking English. I am trained to elicit, rather than give the appropriate language, leading to greater retention rates. I guide clients through a natural process to ever higher levels of skill and confidence.
